    "My research question is looking at the correlation between housing prices and shortfall. Housing affordability is a pivotal issue for my generation, and i believe that the oft touted narrative of phantom overseas buyers is only a narrative meant to distract from the fact that the true cause of housing prices is a lack of new housing as compared to population. \n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to tackle my question by plotting housing price and invetory shortfall. I plan to calculate inventory shortfall by calculating the difference between population increases in regions and the amount of housing built. I will then present this to the reader by visualizing this data in graphs. I may also include the comparison to interest rates, and compare it to the shortfall plot. "
