# Group 01's Vision

Our group is comprised of students from various backgrounds in STEM with varied levels of coding experience, however we all have an interest in investigating the cause for the increased housing costs as it is a topic we all have experience in. We suspect that the increase in housing cost is a multivariate outcome resultant from rising population numbers and a stopgap on the number of new available homes, and we plan on conducting data analysis accordingly with public datasets from Stat Canada that encompass data on these variables. We aim to illucidate the causal relationship between these identified variables and see how they vary between metropolitan areas in Canada, with the intention of providing clear information on the housing affordability of different Canadian hubs. We expect to be on track to finish this project by the beginning of April and will check in with our advisors periodically and have regularly scheduled group meetings to assess our project's timeline.
